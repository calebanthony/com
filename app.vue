                  This project has truly stretched my skills. I've grown as a developer, from sysadmin and server management to front-end UX and design.

                  I had the MVP built and hosted in a couple of weekends (thanks Laravel + Vapor).

                <p>
                  The back-end is built with Filament with some super easy data management tools. The idea is anyone could go in and manage the entire site from the dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I pulled in several 3rd-party APIs to get this all to work. Things like Discord for notifications, a tool built by another developer to support showing player count, a tool to automatically grab images and data from websites for new listings, and even some LLM stuff for writing game descriptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was able to go from idea all the way to the community actually submitting games and talking about the site. This wasn't just a pet project, this met a real need and people actually use it on a regular basis to find new games.
